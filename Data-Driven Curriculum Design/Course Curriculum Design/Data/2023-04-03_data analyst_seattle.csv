The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.

IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which is cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.

POSITION PURPOSE
IHME has an exciting opportunity for a Data Analyst to join our Resource Tracking Development Assistance for Health research team.

The team looks at how DAH is disbursed or received by population, disability-adjusted life years, gross domestic product, and government health spending. The team also looks at all-cause spending for every country from 1995-2050 and HIV/AIDS spending for low- and middle-income countries. Research from this team has been published in a wide set of journals, presented around the globe, and offered online through an interactive visualization. Annually, this team produces the Financing Global Health report. The team’s Data Analyst will work closely with the faculty lead, other data professionals, researchers, and Post-Bachelor Fellows.

This position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages (R or Python). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic team. IHME is a grant funded organization and this position is contingent on project funding availability.

The mission of the Allen Institute is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.
The mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate the understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, we generate useful public resources, drive technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory.
As part of the NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network, the Allen Institute is helping to lead a major new international consortium effort to create a comprehensive cell atlas of the human and closely related non-human primate brain. This project aims to make the most detailed map of the human brain ever produced, linking cellular and molecular phenotypes to brain imaging and functional architecture. To tackle this ambitious goal, we are seeking talented and highly motivated individuals to help create these atlases and help to make them transformative for neuroscience and biomedical research through open data sharing. The atlas will be based on a range of cutting edge high-throughput single cell molecular, spatial and cell phenotyping assays to map the structural and functional organization of the primate brain. We strive to build a catalytic brain cell reference and resource that will dramatically accelerate our understanding of brain structure, function and disease, and to create tools to help the community take advantage of these resources.
We are seeking a motivated data analyst who will aid collaborative efforts to explore the cellular organization of human, non-human primate and mouse brains. They will work under the close mentorship of scientists to analyze large-scale molecular genetics datasets. The successful candidate will quantify molecular features defining neurons – including transcriptional and gene regulatory multi-omics datasets – and compare these features across brain regions and species. They will actively engage with a team of scientists who are leading biologically driven research addressing how changes in brain organization are associated with evolution. They will also work closely with internal and external scientific teams to share and interpret computational analysis of large-scale, cross-species molecular profiling of cells.
The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.

WHO WE ARE
Each year U.S. households spend over $4.6 trillion - about one third of all consumer spending - on recurring bill payments. While staying on top of these bills is the single largest determinant for consumer financial health, organizing and paying them can be a time-consuming and frustrating chore. Since its inception, doxo has been on a mission to simplify and reduce the anxiety of staying on top of bills, empowering consumers to improve their financial health. Our company was founded on the simple idea that there should be an easy and more secure way for consumers to pay all of their bills through a single account, with any payment method, on any device.
As consumers shift more bill payments online and to mobile, doxo continues to experience rapid growth. To date, over eight million doxo users across 97% of U.S. zip codes have paid bills through the payment network, across more than 45 different service categories. With more than 130,000 payable billers, doxo's proprietary, crowd sourced provider directory is the largest in the nation.
In 2021, doxo was named by both BuiltIn and Comparably as a best place to work in Seattle, and was also recognized by both Inc. Magazine and Deloitte as one of the fastest-growing companies in North America. Come join us as we grow the team to further accelerate growth, forever changing the bill pay landscape to focus on the customer.
WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT
doxo is unique in that we have already found product/market fit and that our service is filling an important market need every day.
