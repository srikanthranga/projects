About Us
Pine Park Health is a value-based primary care practice that is redesigning how residents of senior living communities get or stay healthy and lead a life they love. We're on a mission to dramatically improve healthcare for seniors by building a new model of care that's designed around everyone involved — patients, families, community staff members, providers, and payers.
We've started by providing regular prevention and screening, care for chronic conditions, lab work, and diagnostic testing to patients in their apartments. We visit each community weekly to see patients and collaborate on patient health needs with staff. We also make it easier for patients to get care urgently with same- and/or next-day care, helping them avoid the ER and/or hospital where they're exposed to more health issues.
Our value-based offering has led to over 100 communities partnering with us in the last year and allowed us in achieving 10X patient growth. We're a fast-growing company that's backed by lead investors including First Round Capital, Google's AI fund, Canvas Ventures, Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, and Susa. If you share in our vision of helping every senior, no matter their health status, being able to lead a life they find meaningful and worthwhile, join us!
The Opportunity
Pine Park Health is hiring our first Senior Data Analyst to help us care for assisted living residents using data and metrics. This critical role will be supporting the development and execution of the company's overall growth strategy.
You will be responsible for the analytics and insights that will help us understand the performance and impact of our company in the value-based US healthcare environment. Additionally, you will develop a deep understanding of all the factors that influence seniors' health, participate in the product development process, all while supporting our clinical, care growth, implementation, finance and product teams.
What You'll Do
Partner with the management team and project leads (clinical and non-clinical) to design and create input metrics and output metrics that guide improvement and decisions
Support project teams with quantitative work to inform hypothesis selection and evaluation.
Partner with Operations in instrumenting workflows, tools, and systems to collect high-quality data at scale
Develop reporting/dashboards and work closely with internal clients to iterate on content and form as business needs change

Medical, dental and vision insurance.",/rc/clk?jk=4a552c4576dfc264&fccid=a3438249616024f0&vjs=3,"Glencrest is a multifamily investment company founded in 2019 whose mission is to improve the lives of our residents, investors, team and society. We create communities that our residents are proud to call home and currently own twelve of them across four states.
Glencrest was formed in 2019 by apartment industry veteran John Adair (former head of capital transactions at Prime Residential, one of the largest apartment investors in the Western US) and serial tech entrepreneur Mike Bergelson.
We would like to add 2 – 3 critical team members in 2023 to help us keep growing and working to achieve our mission.
Role summary
The Data Hacker / Analyst will be responsible for building and refining systems to retrieve and analyze data from external and internal sources to improve our investment and operations outcomes. This role partners with colleagues in acquisitions, asset management, investor relations and corporate admin to ensure that these functions operate efficiently and can make effective, data-driven decisions.
This role will provide the Data Hacker / Analyst with exposure to all aspects of the multifamily investment business, from determining which markets we should target to identifying trends and benchmarks in the operations of existing assets that others might not see. Additionally, the Data Hacker / Analyst can choose to engage as actively as desired on the development and evolution of modern software solutions that our team and potentially even residents will use to improve their Glencrest experiences.
While much of the work can be done remotely, commuting proximity to our downtown San Francisco office (ideally spending 2 - 3 days a week in the office) is required.
Detailed description of responsibilities
The Data Hacker / Analyst will be the go-to resource at Glencrest for creating standard reports, models, one-off analyses and accessing third party data to help each of our core functions operate efficiently. Additionally, we have begun creating custom software solutions (using third-party developers) to support our internal workflow and expect to do a lot more of this. The Data Hacker / Analyst may choose to play a key role in guiding the development of future software development projects (not required).
Over time, we expect the needs of this function to grow beyond the capacity of a single person so we will look to build the team with internal and external (contractor / vendor) resources.
The position will support each of the following functions (sample projects included):
Asset management
Standard reporting - we have a host of reports that support internal and external decision-making and commitments, e.g., weekly marketing, staff and operations reports, quarterly lender reports, etc. We’d like to automate the creation and distribution of these processes to the extent possible. Additionally, we’d like to enhance the way we track capital expenditures at the property level and across the portfolio; this is an area that offers significant opportunity for creativity with tangible benefits to our business.
Management reporting - we review our portfolio on a quarterly basis and have a first-version package of reports that we use to support this process. We’d like to evolve our reporting package to simplify the process each quarter and augment what’s shared with the team. Over time, we’d like to create dashboards for internal and external data sharing, e.g., for property financial performance and water / energy consumption.
Resident experience - help develop or license passive data collection and surveys to gather resident experience data. Create benchmarks, reports and dashboards to help our team drive improved outcomes.
Property marketing - help improve our ability to collect and analyze data to support optimization of marketing spend per signed lease.
Benchmarking - as our portfolio grows, we have the ability to identify operational trends to support annual budgeting and ongoing asset management.
Acquisitions
Underwriting - we currently use a second-generation underwriting model. This needs to be iteratively improved to ensure flexibility while reducing the risk of mistakes.
Benchmarking - we would like to incorporate internally-generated and externally-accessed operational, transactional and demographic data for target properties. Ideally these data would be accessible from within the underwriting model over time.
Team effectiveness - build and / or test and, ultimately, license and integrate software solutions that support the acquisitions process.
Investor relations
Semi-annual reports - we offer standardized reports to our investors in July and January to keep them informed of the performance of their investments. This process is semi-automated now but can benefit from further refinement over time.
Custom reports - our goal is to provide a top-decile investor experience. To that end, we’d like to offer investors useful ways to view investment performance, e.g., through customized portfolio returns.
Data feeds - we’d like to automate data feeds into investment management platforms used by investment advisors whose clients invest with us.
Admin
Employee reporting - we aspire to be a top employer in the real estate investment industry. To do so, we need to measure our progress in key areas such as employee engagement and sentiment on an ongoing basis.
Expense reimbursement workflow - our team’s expense reimbursement requirements are not simple as we bill certain expenses back to properties we own, e.g., those related to our due diligence or asset management processes. Currently this process is somewhat manual and could be improved.
Key attributes
Possesses unquestionable integrity
Passionate about building a long-term career in the multifamily industry
Interpersonally savvy; easily passes the “Pittsburgh airport test”

Able to prioritize, stay organized and meet critical deadlines

401(k) with company match
Pre-tax healthcare and dependent care flexible spending accounts
Commuter benefits

Training and career development opportunities (still a work in progress; we’re developing our learning and development capabilities but aspire to lead the industry as we evolve).

Glencrest is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status or disability status."

The Employee Relations Division conducts all labor relations activities with City employees and their eight labor organizations and is the heart of labor and employee relations. In addition, they consult with staff across the City on labor contract interpretation and labor and employee relations challenges, opportunities, and solutions. They ensure compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations and HR policies and procedures. This Division also administers the health and welfare benefit program, workers’ compensation program, and oversight to the third-party administrator and administers the occupational health and safety program to ensure a safe,
positive, creative, inclusive, and desirable workplace.

We are currently finishing development and validation of Phase 1 functionality – the ability to compare an existing user or new hire's training curriculum assignments against other users, submit requests for addition or removal of multiple assignments to the Training Administration Group, and route those requests for approval, assignment to a specific Training Admin and tracking of processing status.
Future phases of functionality are planned – ability to request assignments to User Groups (Learner Roles) in addition to direct curriculum assignments, bulk user assignment requests, manager periodic review of personnel's assignments, curriculum content management, periodic review of curriculum contents.
Only high-level requirements have been documented for the future functionality (sometimes in the form of meeting notes and diagrams).
We need a business analyst who can work with the business users to define detailed requirements and UI wireframes and translate those to the developer.
UX/UI design skills are highly desired, because we can't guarantee the software developer will have a good sense of user experience and graphic design.
GTACS is validated, so CSV experience is a must (not performing the validation, but writing testable requirements and reviewing test plans and scripts).

We have an in-house custom-developed software application named GTACS (Gilead Training Assignment and Curriculum Management System), which supplements Compliance Wire with functionality that it is lacking, using a data extract of all training item, curriculum and assignment data from Compliance Wire.
We are currently finishing development and validation of Phase 1 functionality – the ability to compare an existing user or new hire's training curriculum assignments against other users, submit requests for addition or removal of multiple assignments to the Training Administration Group, and route those requests for approval, assignment to a specific Training Admin and tracking of processing status.
Future phases of functionality are planned – ability to request assignments to User Groups (Learner Roles) in addition to direct curriculum assignments, bulk user assignment requests, manager periodic review of personnel's assignments, curriculum content management, periodic review of curriculum contents.
Only high-level requirements have been documented for the future functionality (sometimes in the form of meeting notes and diagrams).
We need a business analyst who can work with the business users to define detailed requirements and UI wireframes and translate those to the developer.
UX/UI design skills are highly desired, because we can't guarantee the software developer will have a good sense of user experience and graphic design.
GTACS is validated, so CSV experience is a must (not performing the validation, but writing testable requirements and reviewing test plans and scripts).
