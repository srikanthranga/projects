Bringing dogs to work, company-wide give-days days, philanthropy and sustainability programs, in-office massages, walking meetings, and free daily exercise classes on-site and at the adjacent gym are just a few ways we make work feel less like work. And the results of our great culture speak for itself: we were certified as a Great Place to Work™ for the sixth year-running in 2022 and ranked in the top 12 on Fortune Magazine’s Best Workplaces in our category for the past four years.

So, what's it like to work here? If you're local, you'll walk into our Emeryville office each Monday morning and find 100 of your colleagues sitting on sofas, beanbag chairs, or the floor excitedly talking through the week ahead and watching one of their colleagues tell their personal life and career journey. Picture a casual and collaborative environment of a start-up, the innovative mindset of a tech company, and the stability of a company with revenue last year of over $1.3 billion, and you'll find us in the sweet spot where world-class culture meets robust business results.

PNC seeks individuals who will thrive in this work environment and will help us build our culture and this high-growth company for the next phase in our amazing journey. Does this sound like you? Then read on.

This position will be responsible for directly managing the PMs on teams in their purview, collaborating extensively with engineering, data science, data analytics, and design, and partnering closely with executives and leaders across operational, clinical, and other non-technical organizations. This position will be responsible for driving collaborative and efficient product development, rollouts, and iteration and will represent their teams at the executive level.
Working with their team, this position will help set our high-level product strategy, shape multiple teams' product roadmaps, unblock and accelerate progress toward our goals, and generally ensure we are prioritizing the right work to maximize both short and long-term impact.

Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Can build an inclusive working environment. That starts with your reports and extends to your cross-functional partners. As a manager, you will need to be able to coach your reports on how to develop a similar environment within their product teams.
Can coach and develop others. You are not only a seasoned and capable executor who still enjoys getting your hands dirty, but you are eager and able to teach others how to do the same. This starts with your reports and extends to a broader group you may mentor.
Can effectively partner with a wide array of cross-functional stakeholders (e.g., Operations, Clinical, Sales, Marketing, Finance) to successfully roll out new products and ensure a great end-to-end customer experience across all departments and locations.
Can craft a clear and compelling product vision and drive broad alignment. This includes being the product domain expert and representing your product areas to audiences ranging from individual engineers to the full executive team.
Can figure out what to work on and drive execution. You can identify, articulate, and prioritize high impact initiatives. You create and execute product roadmaps to achieve our business goals, and you can organize individuals on and outside of your team to drive projects to completion.
Can work with data to do everything from identifying potential areas of opportunity and sizing them to help with prioritization, to using experimentation to measure the impact of new products and features.
Can provide guidance for Engineering, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Design throughout the product development process. You exhibit good judgment in balancing considerations for size of opportunity, scope of development and support costs, risks, and end-user experience.

Education and Experience:
7+ years of experience in Product Management, preferring to work in a fast-paced, Agile environment, with a proven record of delivering high quality software in different business environments
Experience managing Product Managers (3+ at one time strongly preferred)
Experience taking both 0-to-1 and 1-to-N products from concept to a reality

Experience in supply chain is required and analytics experience is a bonus.
Proven track record of multiple years as an individual contributor product manager successfully launching enterprise B2B software productsExperience managing teams of multiple product managers and empowering them to do their best work.

OUR STORY
Since opening our doors in 1965, MAAC has focused on helping individuals and families create the lives they want and deserve. For more than five decades, MAAC has been a champion for underrepresented communities throughout San Diego County, providing families in need with resources to achieve self-sufficiency and improve their living conditions. While the organization first began in the southern region of San Diego, MAAC now operates 35 sites across the county, from San Ysidro to Fallbrook. With an annual operating budget of $46 million, MAAC employs nearly 500 staff who provide life-changing services to 70,000 individuals annually through programs in 5 core focus areas: Education, Economic Development, Health & Wellbeing, Housing, and Advocacy & Leadership Development. Through our wide array of programs, MAAC has grown to become one of the largest nonprofit social service organizations in the community. With regards to housing, MAAC is unique in that we bring together three different areas all under one organization:
Affordable housing developer
Property Manager
Provider of resident services (education, childcare, employment, financial literacy, etc.)
We feel this model enables us to provide a much higher level of service and benefit to the community, through increased accountability and coordination. More importantly, providing all three services enables MAAC to develop a deeper understanding of our resident’s needs through relationships. For more information, please visit: http://www.maacproject.org/
POSITION SUMMARY
MAAC has significantly expanded its affordable housing portfolio over the past few years, which now comprises 6 properties across San Diego County, totaling approximately 1,000 units.

Director of People Talent and Culture

ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
OAKLAND, CA

ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND
The Ella Baker Center for Human Rights (EBC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Oakland, California, organizing to shift resources away from prisons and punishment towards opportunities that make our communities safe, healthy, and strong. Named after civil rights hero Ella Baker, we mobilize Black, Brown, and low-income people to build power in our communities. For over 25 years, we have worked from the community to the legislative level to free our people from state violence. We are currently working to end mass incarceration and mass criminalization in the United States through Truth and Reinvestment—moving resources away from failed criminal legal policies and into creating opportunities, also known as “books not bars, jobs not jails, healthcare not handcuffs.” Through our programs, such as successful organizing in Alameda County, a robust state policy platform, and national leadership in the movement to end mass incarceration, EBC is building a culture of care to replace cages and cops.

The Ella Baker Center Action Fund (EBCAF) is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization and a separate but affiliated organization with the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. EBCAF mobilizes our communities — current and formerly incarcerated people, their loved ones, people who are low income, and Black and Brown communities — to exercise their full political power and hold institutions accountable. Like our namesake Ella Baker, we understand that true power lies within the people. EBCAF was born out of the vision to further build power amongst those most impacted by incarceration and criminalization. We mobilize these communities to ensure that our elected officials are focused on addressing the root causes of harm in our communities instead of investing in failing institutions, such as prisons and policing, that exacerbate that harm.

OUR VALUES
At Ella Baker Center, we win by doing our liberation work in alignment with and guided by our core values:

Prioritize people most impacted by policing and prisons
Accountability
Black Liberation
Interconnection
Transformation
Culture of Care and Healing
Self-Determination


The ideal candidate at EBC understands that our work uplifts the leadership and strategies of those most impacted by the criminal system: working class people of color. Our primary aspiration is Black liberation, as these communities are the most harmed by policing and prisons. We practice accountability to our communities and each other by giving and receiving feedback, communicating directly, and building a culture of restorative justice.

We seek staff who are looking to not only transform the world, but are themselves excited to be personally transformed by organizing for liberation while caring for ourselves or each other. Transformation means that we do not turn anyone away who seeks our advocacy or support based on what the state has charged them with. Inherent in collective liberation work — we ask our staff to do the personal work of organizing to dismantle white supremacy and cisheteropatriarchy, and practice anti-oppression in everyday relationships. Our values mean we are building a leaderful movement, with an emphasis on those who have been systematically denied leadership and power.

Who we are
Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that everyone can code, not just ~0.1% of the population. Our code intelligence platform helps developers and companies with billions of lines of code create the software you use every day. By enabling more people to code, we believe we will create economic opportunity across the world and will drive progress that benefits everyone.
It's an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. Our business is growing rapidly: we've experienced exponential growth and our $125M Series D from Andreessen Horowitz and $50M Series C from Sequoia have given us the opportunity to make big ambitious bets on our future. We have a huge market (every company that builds software) and massive opportunity (most developers haven't even heard of code intelligence yet, but once you've used it, you can't live without it-just like Google). By continuing to hire exceptional people, we have the opportunity to make Sourcegraph one of the biggest technology companies in the world.
Working hours
Given that we are an all-remote company and hire almost anywhere in the world, we don't have a particular time-zone preference for this role. However, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours.
Why this job is exciting
We are creating a machine learning team at Sourcegraph, aimed at creating the most powerful coding assistant in the world. Many companies are trying, but Sourcegraph has a unique advantage: Our rich code intelligence data and powerful code search platform. In the world of prompting LLMs, context is key, and Sourcegraph's context is simply the best you can get: IDE-quality, global-scale, and served lightning fast. Our code intelligence, married with modern AI, is already providing a remarkable alpha code-assistant experience. You can help us unlock its full potential, delivering a product that accelerates development in a way we only see every 10-15 years.
To head up this effort, we are looking for a seasoned and deeply technical engineering leader, versed in programming language semantics, with a strong AI/ML background and familiarity with recent techniques, who can help us deliver the world's best coding assistant and ML-powered developer tooling, built on Sourcegraph's mature, robust, and open code intelligence platform. And if you happen to have an entrepreneurial streak, you're in luck: We have an enterprise distribution pipeline, so whatever you build can be deployed straight to enterprise customers with some of the largest codebases in the world, without all the go-to-market hassle you'd encounter in a startup.
Within one month, you will…
Start building a trusting relationship with your direct reports and peers.
Come up to speed on the Sourcegraph product and platform, which are complex and mature.
Be set up for local development and familiar with the coding assistant's basic architecture.
Ship a substantial new feature to end users.
Within three months, you will…
Help make the Beta launch as solid as possible.
Finish hiring your world-class team.
Be up to speed and driving Sourcegraph's AI strategy.
Within six months, you will…
Have delivered a world-class coding assistant to a dozen big-name companies.
Meet regularly with customers and prospects, representing the company.
Have established a longer-term roadmap that keeps us aligned with expected advances in LLMs.
About you
You are a polyglot hacker in the AI/ML space who wants to build and lead a world-class team to push the boundaries of AI, with a particular focus on leveraging Sourcegraph's code intelligence to leapfrog competitors.
First, you have a deep understanding of programming languages, and tools that manipulate code. This could have taken any number of forms; e.g.:
You've worked with grammars and parser generators, or Treesitter
You've worked with compilers and semantic analysis, e.g. type systems
You've written an interpreter, or worked on a virtual machine
You've done static analysis involving scanning source code for semantic information
It doesn't really matter how you know it, but it's important that you're familiar with the basic concepts of semantic representations of source code, and how they're produced and consumed by tooling.
Second, your AI background could look like a few different things:
You've worked on AI systems and have built ML at large tech companies
You have a deep ML background and have demonstrated an ability to be customer and company focused
You are hands-on and can build machine learning
You are a Prompt Engineer and can take models and figure out how to speak to it in a way that yields different results
You are an entrepreneurial engineer who can hack together prototypes quickly, get things out the door, and iterate
You are an LLM hacker or a thought leader in the LLM space and can craft a roadmap that takes advantage of the space, especially with code intelligence
You've worked in NLP or language models at a top-tier research lab
If you've been anywhere in the field lately, you can probably pick up enough about LLM capabilities to be able to drive this space, as it's all greenfield.
Finally, you shouldn't be a purist about languages. We may need to integrate the coding assistant into a wide variety of tooling contexts, each with its own programming language. You may find yourself writing in several programming languages along the journey, and hopefully you already know most of them a little anyway.
Level
This job is an M4. You can read more about our job leveling philosophy in our Handbook.
Compensation
We pay you an above-average salary because we want to hire the best people who are fully focused on helping Sourcegraph succeed, not worried about paying bills.
